## 🎓 Project Context & Motivation

This project, **"Medieval Village Prototype,"** was developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the successfully completed capstone assignment for **Module 4: Greyboxing in Unreal Engine** of the **[Fundamentals of Level Design with Unreal Engine](https://www.coursera.org/learn/level-design?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This is the third course in the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera, for which the certificate has now been earned.

To accelerate development and focus on level design, this project leveraged core assets: the **Official UE Animation Sample Project** for advanced third-person character locomotion and the **SuperGrid Starter Pack** for rapid prototyping materials and meshes.

The primary achievement was translating the conceptual design from its Level Design Document (LDD) into a fully greyboxed, playable **single-player open-world style medieval village** within Unreal Engine 5.5.1. The focus was on core level design principles: spatial layout, player flow, establishing zones (castle, village, farms), interactive elements, and prototyping opportunities for stealth and exploration. This repository documents the development process and showcases the completed greybox.

## 🎯 Overview

**Medieval Village Prototype** is a completed greybox of a single-player level in **Unreal Engine 5.5.1**. It realizes a small, explorable open-world environment featuring a central castle, an adjacent village with various functional buildings (homes, smithy, tavern, market), farming areas, and opportunities for player interaction.

Development utilized a robust third-person character controller from the **UE Animation Sample Project** and **SuperGrid Starter Pack** assets for efficient blockout. The gameplay is envisioned in a **third-person perspective**, allowing players to roam freely. The design supports future integration of NPCs for quests and stealth/thievery mechanics. This completed greybox establishes the foundational layout, scale, traversal, and basic interactive elements described in the project's LDD, and a project build was successfully submitted for the course.

## 📜 Level Design Document (LDD)

The entire design philosophy, detailed layout, gameplay intentions, and core mechanics for the "Medieval Village Prototype" are documented in the Level Design Document. This document served as the blueprint for the greyboxing process.

## ✨ Key Goals & Features (Achieved in Greybox)

*   🧱 **Effective Greyboxing with SuperGrid & Primitives:** A clear and functional level layout for the castle, village, and farming areas has been created using SuperGrid assets and standard primitive shapes.
*   🚶‍♂️ **Player Path & Flow (Leveraging Advanced Animation System):** Intuitive navigation through the village, castle, and surrounding areas is established, supported by the high-quality character controller from the UE Animation Sample.
*   🏞️ **Zone Definition:** Key zones are clearly defined and blocked out:
    *   **Castle Area:** Main castle, courtyards, surrounding structures, and traversable defensive walls.
    *   **Village Proper:** Four residential homes, a Smithy, a central Tavern, and a Market area.
    *   **Farming Area:** Fields for diverse crops and an Animal Farm area (e.g., for cows/pigs/goats).
*   📐 **Scale & Proportion:** All elements (buildings, paths, cover objects) are appropriately scaled for third-person gameplay.
*   👁️ **Sightlines & Composition:** Strategic sightlines are planned for player guidance, exploration appeal, and potential stealth gameplay.
*   🛡️ **Gameplay Element Prototyping (Spatial):**
    *   Locations for (placeholder) NPCs and their workstations are blocked out.
    *   Building interiors are designed with spaces for lootable chests and lockable doors.
    *   Environmental elements for stealth (bushes, dark areas, alleyways) are incorporated.
    *   Guard patrol routes and posts are defined spatially.
*   📄 **LDD Adherence:** The spatial and interactive concepts from the "Medieval Village Prototype" LDD have been translated into the 3D greybox.
*   💡 **Readability:** Basic lighting and contrasting forms (SuperGrid materials assist here) ensure the level is understandable and navigable.
*   🔄 **Iterative Design & Playtesting:** The level has undergone playtesting for flow, scale, navigation, and basic interaction functionality using the integrated character controller.
*   📦 **Project Build Created & Submitted:** A packaged build of the project was successfully created and submitted for the course.

*(Functionality like AI, skill systems, and complex quests are part of the broader LDD vision; this completed greybox focuses on the spatial foundation and basic interactions).*

## 🔮 Future Plans (Post-Course Development for Portfolio Enhancement)

Now that the course requirements are met, the plan is to further develop this "Medieval Village Prototype" into a more polished and comprehensive portfolio piece. Key areas for future enhancement include:

*   🏡 **Enhanced Level Detail:**
    *   Adding more detailed geometry to buildings (e.g., proper doors, windows, roof details).
    *   Populating interiors with more context-appropriate props.
*   💎 **Interactive Elements:**
    *   Implementing functional treasure chests.
    *   Creating destructible items (barrels, crates) that may yield loot.
    *   Adding collectible items from the environment (e.g., herbs from plants, fruit from trees).
*   🤖 **Basic NPC Implementation:**
    *   Introducing simple walking NPCs to add life to the village.
    *   Implementing basic Guard NPCs with patrol routes and detection cones.
    *   Guards will attempt to "capture" or become hostile if the player is detected in restricted areas or committing crimes.
*   📜 **Simple Quest System:**
    *   Adding a few basic fetch quests or "eliminate target" missions to demonstrate quest flow.
*   🎨 **Visual & Audio Polish:** (Long-term)
    *   Replacing greybox assets with stylized or realistic art assets.
    *   Improving lighting and post-processing for better atmosphere.
    *   Adding ambient sounds and basic SFX.

The goal is to transform this solid greybox foundation into a more complete and engaging game environment that effectively showcases level design, basic gameplay system integration, and world-building skills to potential employers.
